        Hey, I'm Manav Khandelwal 4th-year B.Tech student in Computer Science Engineering at JECRC University, with a passion for web development.
         I love turning concepts into functional, user-friendly applications through hands-on projects that solve real problems.
<br></br>
<br></br>

        I'm adaptable across various tech stacks, but I thrive with modern web tools. 
        Right now, I mostly work with React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, often deploying on platforms like Vercel and GitHub.
